🎬 Translatarr: AI-Powered Subtitle Translator

Any Language to Your Language translation addon.

This project began as a fork of (https://github.com/Kirek66/service.kodilive.translator.ai) but has since evolved using my own logic for translation and only Gemini as AI.

Translatarr is a smart Kodi service that uses Google's Gemini AI to provide high-quality, natural-sounding translations for your movies and TV shows. Unlike traditional translators that work word-for-word, Translatarr understands context, slang, and emotion, giving you subtitles that feel like they were written by a human.

⚡ Quick Start (Get running in 3 steps)
1. Get your Key: Visit Google AI Studio and click "Get API Key". It’s free and takes 30 seconds.
2. Configure: Open Translatarr settings in Kodi. Paste your API Key and select your Target Language (e.g., Romanian).
3. Play a Movie: Start a movie and download an English subtitle using any Kodi subtitle addon. Translatarr will automatically detect it and start the translation!
   
⚙️ Configuration Guide

To get the best results, you can fine-tune Translatarr in the settings menu. Here is what each parameter does:

1. Gemini API Key
   
• What it is: Your personal "password" to use Google's AI.

• Pro Tip: Copy and paste the key directly to avoid typos. If the key is wrong, the addon will stay silent.


2. Model AI
   
• Options: Gemini 2.0 Flash, 1.5 Flash, etc.

• Recommendation: Gemini 2.0 Flash is the fastest and most cost-effective "brain" available right now.


3. Source & Target Language

• Source: The language the original subtitles are in. Use "Auto-Detect" if you aren't sure.

• Target: Always ensure the Target Language is set to a specific language (e.g., Romanian). Setting the Target to "Auto-Detect" will cause the translation to fail or return the original text.

• Target: The language you want to read. Translatarr will save files with the correct language code (e.g., .ro.srt for Romanian, .fr.srt for French).


4. Temperature
   
• What it is: The "Creativity" setting.

• Lower (0.15): Keeps the translation very accurate and literal. Recommended for subtitles.

• Higher (0.7+): Allows the AI to use more creative phrasing and slang.


5. Lines per Chunk
   
• What it is: How many lines are translated at once.

• Recommended: 50 or 100. Larger chunks are faster, but smaller chunks (50) are more reliable for very long movies.


6. Save Folder
    
• Description: The location where your new subtitles are saved.

• Important: This should be a folder that Kodi has permission to read/write, like your Downloads or Media folder.


7. Notification Modes
    
• Show Statistics: Pops up a summary box at the end showing how many lines were translated.

• Simple Notifications: Only shows a small percentage bar at the top of the screen so it doesn't interrupt your viewing.



🛠 Troubleshooting

• No translation appears: Check your API key and ensure the "Save Folder" path is correct in settings.

• Translation stops midway: This usually happens if the AI hits a "Safety Filter" (common in movies with heavy profanity). Try lowering the Temperature.

• Artifacts: If you see strange characters, ensure you are using the latest version of the addon which includes the "Language-Blind" cleaning logic.
